# Fruits Ninga
- An object-oriented model for a full game applying all **OOP** with friendly **GUI** (Java Fx) 
- Including objects movement (animations)
- UML diagrams are also obtained
- Dealing with XML parsers.
- Support **SOLID** principles, help in some logic and to merge the whole project pieces.
